		<p>Bailey Branding is a brand building business that helps its customers achieve success by advising 
		them and doing the research - for a fee, of course - to determine what their branding goals should be,
		what parts of the market they should target with their brand, and how they can develop their brand to
		become a stand-out competitor in their field.</p>
		<p><em>Better Branding Brought By Bailey</em></p>
		<p>An alliterative slogan meant to catch people's attention and let them know we're responsible for improving people's brands.</p>
